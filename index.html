            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my coding portfolio! My name is James. Most of my professional experience has been focused on real estate, and in this field, I have enjoyed using various apps and tools. Over the years, I have become increasingly interested in coding, and so, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Please visit the Coding Portfolio section on this page, which includes some samples of my portfolio that I put together to date while in the program. The links to the deployed application and repository for each sample are provided in that same section. Thank you for visiting my page. Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
